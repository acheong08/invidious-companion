## Upstream Sync Failed

The automated sync with upstream encountered merge conflicts that require manual resolution.

### What happened?

The scheduled rebase of this fork onto the upstream repository failed due to conflicting changes.

### How to resolve

1. Fetch upstream changes locally:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/iv-org/invidious-companion.git  # if not already added
   git fetch upstream
   ```

2. Attempt the rebase manually:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

3. Resolve any conflicts, then:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. Force push the resolved branch:

   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin master
   ```

5. Close this issue once resolved.
